# milav: Measurement Invariance in lavaan

This package exists mostly to collect functions I wrote for performing measurement invariance model comparisons for the Life and Time study.

This package also showcases the [results of simulations of changes in fit indices](https://jflournoy.github.io/milav/articles/simulate-mi-tests.html) in order to evaluate reasonable cutoffs based on the 4-group, 4-wave structure of the data in that study.
